Implement the dice game Dino Hunt Dice with the following rules. (This game is based on the game Dino Hunt Dice published by Steve Jackson Games.)

The game uses 13 colored 6-sided dice:
- 6 green dice: these have dinosaurs on 3 sides, leaves on 2 sides, and a foot on 1 side
- 4 yellow dice: these have dinosaurs on 2 sides, leaves on 2 sides and feet on 2 sides
- 3 red dice: these have dinosaurs on 1 side, leaves on 2 sides, and feet on 3 sides

The object is to capture as many dinosaurs as possible, while avoiding getting stomped. The game runs for a predetermined number of turns, so that each player gets an equal number of turns.

On each turn:
- at the start of the turn, all 13 dice are placed into a pile
- the player randomly selects 3 dice and rolls them (if fewer than 3 dice are remaining, the player rolls all the remaining dice)
- any dice showing dinosaurs and feet are set aside; any dice showing leaves are put back into the pile of unrolled dice
- if the player has rolled 3 or more feet during the turn, the player has been stomped: they lose all the dinosaurs captured during the turn and their turn ends.
- the player can stop and score 1 point for each dinosaur captured, or can continue rolling.

The player with the highest score wins.
